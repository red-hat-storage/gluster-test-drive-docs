To make your Gluster experience awesome, the contents of this test drive have been divided into following modules.\n\n\n\n\nModule 1 :\n Introduction to Gluster concepts\n\n\nModule 2 :\n Volume Setup and Client Access\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Gluster?\n\u00b6\n\n\nGluster provides a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective data management platform, streamlining file and object access across physical, virtual, and cloud environments. You can read more about gluster here https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/storage\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you are a Windows user, you will need a Secure Shell client like PuTTY to connect to your instance. If you do not have it already, you can download the PuTTY client here: http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe\n\n\nMac and Linux users, you will use your preferred terminal application to connect to EC2 (this should already be installed on your machine). For accessing the Windows system interface via RDP, you will need a RDP client program such as \nVinagre\n on Linux or the \nMicrosoft Remote Desktop\n client for Mac. Vinagre is likely available for your Linux distribution using your standard package manager. You can download the Mac RDP client here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18140\n\n\nGetting to know your lab environment\n\u00b6\n\n\nStarting the lab\n\u00b6\n\n\nOn the \nLab Details\n tab, notice the lab properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Time -\n The estimated time for the lab to start your instance so you can access the lab environment.\n\n\nDuration -\n The estimated time the lab should take to complete.\n\n\nAccess -\n The time the lab will run before automatically shutting down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nStart Lab\n to launch your \nqwik\nLABS.

In this lab we will:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Gluster trusted pool\n\n\nManually create a Gluster distributed volume\n\n\nAutomatically create a Gluster replicated volume using gdeploy\n\n\nUnderstand basic Gluster CLI commands\n\n\nWrite files to our volumes with the Gluter native client, NFS, and SMB\n\n\nObserve the data layout on the Gluster bricks\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Trusted Pool\n\u00b6\n\n\nConnect to the \nrhgs1\n server instance using its public IP address from the \nAddl. Info\n tab (Linux/Mac example below).\n\n\nssh -i <path-to-pem> ec2-user@<public_ip>\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in creating a Gluster trusted pool is node peering. From one node, all of the other nodes should be peered using the gluster CLI. As our lab only has two nodes, you only need to run one peer probe command from node \nrhgs1\n. Run the below command to probe the peer.\n\n\nsudo gluster peer probe rhgs2\n\n\n\n\nNote the success Message:\n\n\npeer probe: success.\n\n\nA \ntrusted pool\n is defined as a group of Gluster nodes peered together for the purpose of sharing their local storage and compute resources for one or more logical filesystem namespaces. The state of a trusted pool and its members can be viewed with two important commands: \ngluster peer status\n and \ngluster pool list\n.\n\n\nsudo gluster peer status\n\n\n\n\nNote the \npeer status\n command only reports the remote peers of the local node from which the command is run, excluding itself (localhost) from the list. This can be confusing for first-time users.\n\n\nNumber of Peers: 1\n\n\nHostname: rhgs2\n\n\nUuid: 15a57a7f-b895-4b5c-8031-943bd8bcb0d1\n\n\nState: Peer in Cluster (Connected)\n\n\nThe \npool list\n command provides similar output in a tabular format and includes the local node, thus giving a complete view of the Gluster trusted pool.\n\n\nsudo gluster pool list\n\n\n\n\nUUID                  Hostname    State\n\n\n15a57a7f-b895-4b5c-8031-943bd8bcb0d1  rhgs2       Connected\n\n\nda4fe9c8-596a-4a13-9f49-f7fa057879d6  localhost   Connected\n\n\nCreating a Distributed Volume\n\u00b6\n\n\nA unit of storage on a node is referred to as a \nbrick\n. A brick is simply a local filesystem that has been presented to the Gluster system for consumption. Each brick has an associated \nglusterfsd\n process on its system.\n\n\nWhen a Gluster volume is created, its default architecture is \ndistribution\n. A distributed volume simply groups storage from different bricks together into one unified namespace, resulting in a Gluster volume as large as the sum of all of the bricks. This architecture uses a hashing algorithm for pseudo-random distribution of files across the the bricks, resulting in statistically even distribution of files across the bricks.\n\n\nWe will use the gluster CLI to create a 2-brick distributed volume named \ndistvol\n. Note that for the sake of this lab the backing filesystems on the nodes have been pre-configured and mounted to \n/rhgs/brick_vdb\n. You can view the LVM and filesystem configurations with the commands below.\n\n\nsudo vgdisplay -v /dev/rhgs_vg\n\n\n\n\nUsing volume group(s) on command line.\n\n\n--- Volume group ---\n\n\nVG Name               rhgs_vg\n\n\nSystem ID\n\n\nFormat                lvm2\n\n\nMetadata Areas        1\n\n\nMetadata Sequence No  7\n\n\nVG Access             read/write\n\n\nVG Status             resizable\n\n\nMAX LV                0\n\n\nCur LV                2\n\n\nOpen LV               1\n\n\nMax PV                0\n\n\nCur PV                1\n\n\nAct PV                1\n\n\nVG Size               10.00 GiB\n\n\nPE Size               4.00 MiB\n\n\nTotal PE              2559\n\n\nAlloc PE / Size       2559 / 10.00 GiB\n\n\nFree  PE / Size       0 / 0\n\n\nVG UUID               sHGNaI-ODzz-aZV3-j602-aDZQ-DUUU-ddbK7X\n\n\n--- Logical volume ---\n\n\nLV Name                rhgs_thinpool\n\n\nVG Name                rhgs_vg\n\n\nLV UUID                A3FlQv-X8K7-IQE0-cYUZ-eEJk-ROVe-hkboxV\n\n\nLV Write Access        read/write\n\n\nLV Creation host, time ip-172-31-2-112.ec2.internal, 2016-07-27 10:56:26 -0400\n\n\nLV Pool metadata       rhgs_thinpool_tmeta\n\n\nLV Pool data           rhgs_thinpool_tdata\n\n\nLV Status              available\n\n\n# open                 2\n\n\nLV Size                9.97 GiB\n\n\nAllocated pool data    0.11%\n\n\nAllocated metadata     0.65%\n\n\nCurrent LE             2553\n\n\nSegments               1\n\n\nAllocation             inherit\n\n\nRead ahead sectors     auto\n\n\n- currently set to     8192\n\n\nBlock device           253:2\n\n\n--- Logical volume ---\n\n\nLV Path                /dev/rhgs_vg/rhgs_lv\n\n\nLV Name                rhgs_lv\n\n\nVG Name                rhgs_vg\n\n\nLV UUID                L2f6yD-NhfH-2Mm7-gX5S-b8Ee-2dXL-Pb0HGK\n\n\nLV Write Access        read/write\n\n\nLV Creation host, time ip-172-31-2-112.ec2.internal, 2016-07-27 10:56:49 -0400\n\n\nLV Pool name           rhgs_thinpool\n\n\nLV Status              available\n\n\n# open                 1\n\n\nLV Size                10.00 GiB\n\n\nMapped size            0.11%\n\n\nCurrent LE             2560\n\n\nSegments               1\n\n\nAllocation             inherit\n\n\nRead ahead sectors     auto\n\n\n- currently set to     8192\n\n\nBlock device           253:4\n\n\n--- Physical volumes ---\n\n\nPV Name               /dev/xvdb\n\n\nPV UUID               OmPpve-V6qZ-fcvx-DFMq-nrPr-Aeoh-0X2FFg\n\n\nPV Status             allocatable\n\n\nTotal PE / Free PE    2559 / 0\n\n\nsudo df -h /rhgs/brick_vdb\n\n\n\n\nFilesystem                   Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n\n\n/dev/mapper/rhgs_vg-rhgs_lv   10G   33M   10G   1% /rhgs/brick_vdb\n\n\nNow create the 2-brick \ndistvol\n Gluster volume.\n\n\nsudo gluster volume create distvol rhgs1:/rhgs/brick_vdb/distvol rhgs2:/rhgs/brick_vdb/distvol\n\n\n\n\nNote the output, volume created successfuly and we have to start the volume:\n\n\nvolume create: distvol: success: please start the volume to access data\n\n\nStart the volume\n\n\nsudo gluster volume start distvol\n\n\n\n\nvolume start: distvol: success\n\n\nAutomated Creation of a Replicate Volume\n\u00b6\n\n\nGluster volume configurations can become much more complicated than the basic example above as the scale grows and additional features are leveraged. In order to simplify and automate the deployment process, Red Hat has introduced an \nAnsible\n-based deployment tool called \ngdeploy\n. With gdeploy, an end-to-end Gluster architecture can be defined in a configuration file, and the entire deployment can be executed with a single command.\n\n\nWe will now build a \nreplicated\n volume using the gdeploy method. A replicated volume architecture groups Gluster bricks into replica peers, storing multiple copies of the files as they are being written by the Gluster clients.\n\n\nFor this replicated volume deployment, the backing filesystems have \nnot\n been pre-configured as in the above distributed volume example. The provided gdeploy configuration file includes all of the information needed to setup the \n/dev/vdc\n block devices with \nLVM\n thin provisioning and format and mount an \nXFS\n filesystem. It then further defines the Gluster volume architecture for the rep01 volume.\n\n\nView the gdeploy configuration file with the below command.\n\n\ncat ~/rep01.conf\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\n# Usage:\n\n\n#       gdeploy -c rep01.conf\n\n\n#\n\n\n# This does backend setup first and then create the volume using the\n\n\n# setup bricks.\n\n\n#\n\n\n#\n\n\n[hosts]\n\n\nn1\n\n\nn2\n\n\n# Common backend setup for 2 of the hosts.\n\n\n[backend-setup]\n\n\ndevices=vdc\n\n\nvgs=rhgs_vg2\n\n\npools=rhgs_thinpool2\n\n\nlvs=rhgs_lv2\n\n\nmountpoints=/rhgs/brick_vdc\n\n\nbrick_dirs=/rhgs/brick_vdc/rep01\n\n\n[volume]\n\n\naction=create\n\n\nvolname=rep01\n\n\nreplica=yes\n\n\nreplica_count=2\n\n\nforce=yes\n\n\nIn order to use \ngdeploy\n, the node from which it is run requires passwordless ssh access to the root account on all nodes in the Gluster trusted pool (including itself, if the gdeploy node is also a Gluster pool node, as it is in this example).\n\n\nNOTE:\n \nAmazon AWS by default uses only keypairs for SSH authentication and configures no password-based access to the instances. Because of this, we have pre-populated keys to allow the ec2-user user on each node to login as the root user on all nodes using the \n~/.ssh/id_rsa\n private key.\n \nThe commands below are for reference only and do not need to be run for this lab.\n\n\nssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa -N ''\n\n\nfor i in 1 2; do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@n$i; done\n\n\nWith passwordless ssh configured, we can deploy the \nrep01\n volume using the \ngdeploy\n command (NOTE because we rely on the ssh keys, we do not need sudo for this command).\n\n\ngdeploy -vv -c ~/rep01.conf\n\n\n\n\nViewing Volume Details\n\u00b6\n\n\nInformation about Gluster volumes, including their architecture, configuration specifics, processes, and ports can be viewed with the below two commands.\n\n\nThe \ngluster volume info\n command shows configuration and operational details about your Gluster volumes.

For some particular use cases, the NFS protocol may also offer a performance benefit over other access methods.\n\n\nYou can connect to the \nclient1\n system from your local ssh client using the lab PEM file (Linux/Mac example below).\n\n\nssh -i <PEM_FILE> ec2-user@<PUBLIC_IP>\n\n\n\n\nHere we mount the Gluster distvol volume we created above on a RHEL client.\n\n\nsudo mkdir -p /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol\n\n\n\n\nsudo mount -t nfs rhgs1:/distvol /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol\n\n\n\n\nCheck the mount and observe the output.\n\n\ndf -h /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol\n\n\n\n\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n\n\nrhgs1:/distvol      20G   66M   20G   1% /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol\n\n\nmount | grep distvol\n\n\n\n\nrhgs1:/distvol on /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol type nfs (rw,relatime,vers=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=10.100.1.11,mountvers=3,mountport=38465,mountproto=tcp,local_lock=none,addr=10.100.1.11)\n\n\nCreate and set permissions on a directory to hold our data.\n\n\nsudo mkdir /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol/mydir\nsudo chmod 777 /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol/mydir\n\n\n\n\nAdd 100 files to the directory.\n\n\nfor i in {001..100}; do echo hello$i > /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol/mydir/file$i; done\n\n\n\n\nList the directory, counting its contents.\n\n\nls /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol/mydir/ | wc -l\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\nNative Client Access\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Gluster native client utilizes \nFilesystem in Userspace (FUSE)\n technology to implement a client access protocol that is POSIX-compatible and has the distinct advantage that the client is fully aware of the Gluster volume architecture. This means that with a redundant volume architecture (replicate or disperse), the client automatically has \nhighly-available\n access to the Gluster volume data without any special configuration.\n\n\nAdditionally, the native client can benefit from multiple data paths and specific protocol tunings, allowing for greater overall throughput and lower latency under most workloads.\n\n\nHere on the same client we mount the Gluster \ndistvol\n volume a second time, this time using the Gluster native client.\n\n\nsudo mkdir -p /rhgs/client/native/distvol\nsudo mount -t glusterfs rhgs1:distvol /rhgs/client/native/distvol/\n\n\n\n\nExamine the new mount.\n\n\ndf -h /rhgs/client/native/distvol/\n\n\n\n\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n\n\nrhgs1:distvol       20G   67M   20G   1% /rhgs/client/native/distvol\n\n\nWe can see here that the Gluster volume is \nmounted twice by the two different protocols\n.\n\n\nmount | grep distvol\n\n\n\n\nrhgs1:/distvol on /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol type nfs (rw,relatime,vers=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=10.100.1.11,mountvers=3,mountport=38465,mountproto=tcp,local_lock=none,addr=10.100.1.11)\n\n\nrhgs1:distvol on /rhgs/client/native/distvol type fuse.glusterfs (rw,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,max_read=131072)\n\n\nListing the files from our new native mount point, we can see that the files we created through the original NFS mount point are visible.\n\n\nls /rhgs/client/native/distvol/mydir/ | wc -l\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\nNow we\u2019ll create an additional set of 100 files, this time through the new native client mount point.\n\n\nfor i in {101..200}; do echo hello$i > /rhgs/client/native/distvol/mydir/file$i; done\n\n\n\n\nWe can now see that the 200 total files are available through \nboth\n the native and NFS mount points.\n\n\nls /rhgs/client/native/distvol/mydir/ | wc -l\n\n\n\n\n200\n\n\nls /rhgs/client/nfs/distvol/mydir/ | wc -l\n\n\n\n\n200\n\n\nWindows Client Access\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to make our Gluster volume available to Windows clients, we need to make a few configuration changes.

Info  tab (Linux/Mac example below).  ssh -i <path-to-pem> ec2-user@<public_ip>  The first step in creating a Gluster trusted pool is node peering. From one node, all of the other nodes should be peered using the gluster CLI. As our lab only has two nodes, you only need to run one peer probe command from node  rhgs1 . Run the below command to probe the peer.  sudo gluster peer probe rhgs2  Note the success Message:  peer probe: success.  A  trusted pool  is defined as a group of Gluster nodes peered together for the purpose of sharing their local storage and compute resources for one or more logical filesystem namespaces. The state of a trusted pool and its members can be viewed with two important commands:  gluster peer status  and  gluster pool list .  sudo gluster peer status  Note the  peer status  command only reports the remote peers of the local node from which the command is run, excluding itself (localhost) from the list. This can be confusing for first-time users.

Each brick has an associated  glusterfsd  process on its system.  When a Gluster volume is created, its default architecture is  distribution . A distributed volume simply groups storage from different bricks together into one unified namespace, resulting in a Gluster volume as large as the sum of all of the bricks. This architecture uses a hashing algorithm for pseudo-random distribution of files across the the bricks, resulting in statistically even distribution of files across the bricks.

            "text": "Gluster volume configurations can become much more complicated than the basic example above as the scale grows and additional features are leveraged. In order to simplify and automate the deployment process, Red Hat has introduced an  Ansible -based deployment tool called  gdeploy . With gdeploy, an end-to-end Gluster architecture can be defined in a configuration file, and the entire deployment can be executed with a single command.  We will now build a  replicated  volume using the gdeploy method. A replicated volume architecture groups Gluster bricks into replica peers, storing multiple copies of the files as they are being written by the Gluster clients.  For this replicated volume deployment, the backing filesystems have  not  been pre-configured as in the above distributed volume example. The provided gdeploy configuration file includes all of the information needed to setup the  /dev/vdc  block devices with  LVM  thin provisioning and format and mount an  XFS  filesystem. It then further defines the Gluster volume architecture for the rep01 volume.  View the gdeploy configuration file with the below command.  cat ~/rep01.conf  #  # Usage:  #       gdeploy -c rep01.conf  #  # This does backend setup first and then create the volume using the  # setup bricks.  #  #  [hosts]  n1  n2  # Common backend setup for 2 of the hosts.

NOTE:   Amazon AWS by default uses only keypairs for SSH authentication and configures no password-based access to the instances. Because of this, we have pre-populated keys to allow the ec2-user user on each node to login as the root user on all nodes using the  ~/.ssh/id_rsa  private key.   The commands below are for reference only and do not need to be run for this lab.  ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa -N ''  for i in 1 2; do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@n$i; done  With passwordless ssh configured, we can deploy the  rep01  volume using the  gdeploy  command (NOTE because we rely on the ssh keys, we do not need sudo for this command).  gdeploy -vv -c ~/rep01.conf",
